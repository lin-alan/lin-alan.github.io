    <h1><u>My story when I came to Japan.</u></h1>
    <p>Arrived into NADI international airport at night, we (3 including me) 
        <br>were expecting someone to guide us but were left into 
        <br>surprise that no one was there. We managed to stay the night at 
        <br>the airport and to catch our flight the next morning into Suva. As 
        <br>we arrived into Suva, same thing happened no one was there to guide 
        <br>us, we had to manage our own way to town and find our one night 
        <br>accommodation. The next moment we did was to google the Japanese 
        <br>embassy and headed straight there to get our visa, we stay the 
        <br>night in Suva and flew back to NADI the next morning, few hours 
        <br>into waiting we are off to Tokyo transiting in South Korea.</p> 
    <p>We arrived into Tokyo(Narita airport) at around 10pm. I am placed to
        <br>study in Tokyo while one of friend is placed to study in Osaka
        <br>and the other in Kagoshima. So they had to catch another domestic
        <br> flight tomorrow morning. I searched around but no one was there 
        <br>to pick me up, the airport was empty. So I followed my friends to
        <br> the nearby hotel to stay overnight(didn‚Äôt had a good sleep after
        <br> the flight and plus I was anxious about no one was there at the 
        <br>airport waiting for me). The next morning we headed back to the 
        <br>airport, both of my friends had left Tokyo towards their final destination.</p> 
    <p>I am left alone, it was around 7am I waited at the airport, repeatedly
        <br> walking from one exit to the other to find my agent that was 
        <br>supposed to meet me. 1hr in, i am getting anxious and more nervous, 
        <br>changed some coins to call on the telephone booth(using hand gestures
        <br>to ask a Japanese person on how this work), no one from the University
        <br>answer my call. I waited and at the far end I found my agent, which 
        <br>she guided me into a taxi (that time I didn‚Äôt knew that taxi is super
        <br>expensive in Japan, but I don‚Äôt need to pay üôÇ), it took me about
        <br> an hour and a half to reach the University.</p> 
    <p>A lady came and guided me to my dorm to put my luggage and she told 
        <br>me that I am already late for class so she told me to bring a pen
        <br> with me, she then guided me to JLC(Japanese language center) to 
        <br>my respective classroom, I was assigned to A class(0% Japanese, 
        <br>beginner class), I opened the door, there were 7 international 
        <br>students and a Japanese teacher. The students greeted me in 
        <br>Japanese (probably it was ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù) which I knew nothing 
        <br>about(I was thinking did I entered the wrong classroom?). I sat down
        <br> the teacher walk up to me and placed around 7 textbooks on my 
        <br>desk, I was shocked.</p>  
    <p>It was lunch break which I meet ito sensei my tutor teacher. He guided
        <br> me to the cafeteria and it was so crowded so I got a sandwich 
        <br>from the convenient store instead. He told me to come back to class
        <br> after lunch, so I quickly had my lunch, went back to my dorm for a 
        <br>while and headed back to class. Class ended and that day we also had 
        <br>a orientation about computers, I am already exhausted but managed 
        <br>to attend. Came back to my dorm around 8pm and realized that I couldn‚Äôt 
        <br>charge my phone or laptop due to the different sockets in Japan. 
        <br>There is no wifi but only the LAN cable which I can connect to the 
        <br>internet. I message my family telling them that I am already settled down.</p>  
    <p>The next few days, I realized I am the only one in class knowing nothing 
        <br>what the teacher is teaching about, I am unable to response when 
        <br>the teacher ask me for an answer, I replied ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Äù 
        <br>in English. A teacher told me that I need to read this textbook 
        <br>and prepare for tomorrow‚Äôs lesson.  Classes were getting intensive 
        <br>day by day, as soon as I went back to my dorm, sat on the chair I 
        <br>dozed off straight away. Day by day passes, I called my family that 
        <br>I needed to come back, I couldn‚Äôt handle this. But I manage to keep 
        <br>myself focus.</p>  
    <p>Since I am the first to come to Japan in this program from Vanuatu. 
        <br>There is no senpai(senior or someone that took the same program 
        <br>as me from Vanuatu for the previous years) to ask information 
        <br>or help. I spend the first few months struggling in everything here. 
        <br>I always put a smile on my face, but I suffered from depression and anxiety.</p>  
    <p>We had about 50+ international students in this program. And from Oceania
        <br>only 1 Australian and me. Most of the international students were
        <br>from Asia. We soon had science and math classes, and were all in Japanese. 
        <br>The knowledge level of my classmates(50+ international students)
        <br>were up to some point that I couldn‚Äôt imagine. They are super smart, 
        <br>while I am struggling with maths, physics, chemistry and Japanese
        <br>(couldn‚Äôt compare high school in Vanuatu with other countries in Asia).</p>  
    <p>Months passed, almost graduating from the language school. Handed my teachers
        <br>gifts and told my experience with one of my teacher of what had happened 
        <br>throughout the struggle I had that year, halfway into my talk couldn‚Äôt 
        <br>hold back my tears, first time that I ever got so emotional. My teacher 
        <br>heard my story and she was also emotionally touch. I couldn‚Äôt but 
        <br>had to share this with her.</p>  
    <p> Now that you have read my story. ‚ÄúNever give up‚Äù ‚ÄúNever lose hope‚Äù may 
        <br>sound so simple and common but it is really powerful that encourages me 
        <br>on moving forward. If I can do it YOU CAN.</p> 
    <p>*with the world now facing a new virus, let‚Äôs put away racism, politics etc 
        <br>and by doing your part by staying at home. With god we can overcome this battle.</p>
