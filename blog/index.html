    <h1><u>My story when I came to Japan.</u></h1>
    <p>Arrived into NADI international airport at night, we (3 including me) 
        were expecting someone to guide us but were left into 
        surprise that no one was there. We managed to stay the night at 
        the airport and to catch our flight the next morning into Suva. As 
        we arrived into Suva, same thing happened no one was there to guide 
        us, we had to manage our own way to town and find our one night 
        accommodation. The next moment we did was to google the Japanese 
        embassy and headed straight there to get our visa, we stay the 
        night in Suva and flew back to NADI the next morning, few hours 
        into waiting we are off to Tokyo transiting in South Korea.</p> 
    <p>We arrived into Tokyo(Narita airport) at around 10pm. I am placed to
        study in Tokyo while one of friend is placed to study in Osaka
        and the other in Kagoshima. So they had to catch another domestic
         flight tomorrow morning. I searched around but no one was there 
        to pick me up, the airport was empty. So I followed my friends to
         the nearby hotel to stay overnight(didn‚Äôt had a good sleep after
         the flight and plus I was anxious about no one was there at the 
        airport waiting for me). The next morning we headed back to the 
        airport, both of my friends had left Tokyo towards their final destination.</p> 
    <p>I am left alone, it was around 7am I waited at the airport, repeatedly
         walking from one exit to the other to find my agent that was 
        supposed to meet me. 1hr in, i am getting anxious and more nervous, 
        changed some coins to call on the telephone booth(using hand gestures
        to ask a Japanese person on how this work), no one from the University
        answer my call. I waited and at the far end I found my agent, which 
        she guided me into a taxi (that time I didn‚Äôt knew that taxi is super
        expensive in Japan, but I don‚Äôt need to pay üôÇ), it took me about
         an hour and a half to reach the University.</p> 
    <p>A lady came and guided me to my dorm to put my luggage and she told 
        me that I am already late for class so she told me to bring a pen
         with me, she then guided me to JLC(Japanese language center) to 
        my respective classroom, I was assigned to A class(0% Japanese, 
        beginner class), I opened the door, there were 7 international 
        students and a Japanese teacher. The students greeted me in 
        Japanese (probably it was ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù) which I knew nothing 
        about(I was thinking did I entered the wrong classroom?). I sat down
         the teacher walk up to me and placed around 7 textbooks on my 
        desk, I was shocked.</p>  
    <p>It was lunch break which I meet ito sensei my tutor teacher. He guided
         me to the cafeteria and it was so crowded so I got a sandwich 
        from the convenient store instead. He told me to come back to class
         after lunch, so I quickly had my lunch, went back to my dorm for a 
        while and headed back to class. Class ended and that day we also had 
        a orientation about computers, I am already exhausted but managed 
        to attend. Came back to my dorm around 8pm and realized that I couldn‚Äôt 
        charge my phone or laptop due to the different sockets in Japan. 
        There is no wifi but only the LAN cable which I can connect to the 
        internet. I message my family telling them that I am already settled down.</p>  
    <p>The next few days, I realized I am the only one in class knowing nothing 
        what the teacher is teaching about, I am unable to response when 
        the teacher ask me for an answer, I replied ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Äù 
        in English. A teacher told me that I need to read this textbook 
        and prepare for tomorrow‚Äôs lesson.  Classes were getting intensive 
        day by day, as soon as I went back to my dorm, sat on the chair I 
        dozed off straight away. Day by day passes, I called my family that 
        I needed to come back, I couldn‚Äôt handle this. But I manage to keep 
        myself focus.</p>  
    <p>Since I am the first to come to Japan in this program from Vanuatu. 
        There is no senpai(senior or someone that took the same program 
        as me from Vanuatu for the previous years) to ask information 
        or help. I spend the first few months struggling in everything here. 
        I always put a smile on my face, but I suffered from depression and anxiety.</p>  
    <p>We had about 50+ international students in this program. And from Oceania
        only 1 Australian and me. Most of the international students were
        from Asia. We soon had science and math classes, and were all in Japanese. 
        The knowledge level of my classmates(50+ international students)
        were up to some point that I couldn‚Äôt imagine. They are super smart, 
        while I am struggling with maths, physics, chemistry and Japanese
        (couldn‚Äôt compare high school in Vanuatu with other countries in Asia).</p>  
    <p>Months passed, almost graduating from the language school. Handed my teachers
        gifts and told my experience with one of my teacher of what had happened 
        throughout the struggle I had that year, halfway into my talk couldn‚Äôt 
        hold back my tears, first time that I ever got so emotional. My teacher 
        heard my story and she was also emotionally touch. I couldn‚Äôt but 
        had to share this with her.</p>  
    <p> Now that you have read my story. ‚ÄúNever give up‚Äù ‚ÄúNever lose hope‚Äù may 
        sound so simple and common but it is really powerful that encourages me 
        on moving forward. If I can do it YOU CAN.</p> 
    <p>*with the world now facing a new virus, let‚Äôs put away racism, politics etc 
        and by doing your part by staying at home. With god we can overcome this battle.</p>
